# next-trip-app

React Application that makes use of Metro Transit nexttrip2 api. This web app currrently renders 2 routes, a home page and a next trip page. The next-trip page can be used to get a list of stops for a selected transit route. 

# Technologies Implemented
* React
* React Router
* Styled Components
* CSS Grids

# Case Study Goals

[X] Select a transit route from a list of available routes.
[X] Select a direction from selected transit route.
[X] Implment routing: / and /next-trip
[] Implement testing
[] Deploy to publically available URL

### Enhancements 
[] Allow user to Select Agency they would like see trip information for
[] Create Theming system around which Agency is selected
[] Incoporate real time stop infomation into next-trip page
[] Implement react context to handle selected Agency


# Case Study Assumptions

Made a few assumptions with this case study. The first was it was ok to use the create react app for configuring intial React boiler plate. Also I  did not implement a Component Library instead opting to create and stlye custom components. Leveraged styled-components to quickly create and style custom components used within application.    


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
